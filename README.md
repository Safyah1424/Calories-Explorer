This program helps people discover the amount of calories in their meals. Moreover, meals vary between several types of food such as pasta, pizza, chicken and even drinks. First, when we run the program it shows a welcome message depending on your device’s current time, it shows “good morning” if it’s before noon and “good evening if it’s past 12 pm. Then you will have to choose a number. This number represents a category of food as I mentioned earlier. Then you will be able to pick a specific dish. Finally, the calories of that dish will be displayed on the screen. It’s useful if you are on a diet and you need to calculate the amount of calories allowed for you.
